== Overview

Installed CNC lead screws from https://arizonacnckits.com/pm-30-cnc-kit.html[Arizona CNC], two 4.8Nm steppers on the X & Y, and a 12Nm stepper on the Z. Control is programmed in LinuxCNC talking over ethernet to a https://store.mesanet.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=290[Mesa 7i76e] inside a custom control cabinet. It is currently programmed/wired with a MPG, touch probe, and tool offset.

Currently I do not have the spindle control wired into the Mesa board, but it isn't really a problem at the moment.
